        <h2>The Raptors are born!</h2>
        <p id="history">
            The Raptors are the second team to be in Toronto and one of 3 all-time to be in Canada. The first Toronto based team was the Toronto Huskies who played the first ever NBA game where they lost to the Knicks.
            The Huskies lasted only one season and the NBA would not return to Canada for another half-century. The city of Toronto was awarded a franchise in 1993, and months later the city of Vancouver was also awarded a franchise.
            With the Grizzlies relocation to Memphis, the Raptors are the only NBA team in Canada.
